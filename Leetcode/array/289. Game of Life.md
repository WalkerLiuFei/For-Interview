# Game of Life

## 问题描述

According to the [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a *board* with *m* by *n* cells, each cell has an initial state *live* (1) or *dead* (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]
```

**Follow up**:

1. Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
2. In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?

## 解题思路

首先确定状态会变的两种状态

1. 活细胞当周围有少于两个活细胞或者多余三个活细胞会死亡
2. 死细胞当周围有恰好三个活细胞时会复活

即：当周围的活细胞   count !=  3, 细胞死。当count = 3细胞活， 

3 用二进制表示为 11，01和00，当 11 & 01 = 01 ， 11 & 00 = 00，

细胞`[i,j]`的的八个邻居

1. `[i-1,j]`
2. `[i-1,j-1]`
3. `[i-1,j+1]`
4. `[i+1,j]`
5. `[i+1,j-1]`
6. `[i+1,j+1]`
7. `[i,j-1]`
8. `[i,j+1]`

只要判断这八个细胞的状态即可，对于边界条件，由于细胞的状态变化只依赖于活细胞，所以碰到边界返回就和死细胞状态是一样的`false`即可

通过`O(MN)`遍历加上`O(MN)`空间复杂度其实很简单，问题在于是不是可以本地进行？不需要`O(MN)`的空间。

可以通过

### 通过多状态

第一次遍历之后进行状态标记，利用多余的状态变量，然后第二次遍历时进行遍历标记，厉害！

```java
// in-place solution
class Solution {
    // all eight possible directions
    private static final int[][] directions = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {1,1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {1, -1}};
    private static final int ALIVE = 1;
    private static final int DEAD = 0;
    private static final int DEADTOALIVE = 2;
    private static final int ALIVETODEAD = 3;
    
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        // iterate through every cell in this 2D array
        for (int r = 0; r < board.length; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < board[0].length; c++) {
                // keep track of the number of alive neighbors
                int alive = 0;
                
                // for each cell, check all possible 8 directions and count the number of alive neighbors
                for (int[] direction : directions) {
                    alive += isAlive(board, r + direction[0], c + direction[1]) ? 1 : 0;
                }
                
                // in case current cell is dead but has 3 live neighbors
                if (board[r][c] == DEAD) {
                    if (alive == 3) {
                        board[r][c] = DEADTOALIVE;
                    }
                } 
                // in case current cell is alive
                else {
                    // in case, only 2 or 3 neighbors are alive
                    if (alive != 2 && alive != 3) {
                        board[r][c] = ALIVETODEAD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (int r = 0; r < board.length; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < board[0].length; c++) {
                if (board[r][c] == DEADTOALIVE) {
                    board[r][c] = ALIVE;
                }
                else if (board[r][c] == ALIVETODEAD) {
                    board[r][c] = DEAD;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    private boolean isAlive(int[][] board, int r, int c) {
        return r >= 0 && r < board.length && c >= 0 && c < board[0].length && (board[r][c] == ALIVE || board[r][c] == ALIVETODEAD);
    }   
}
```





通过 bit 操作！太惊艳了！
