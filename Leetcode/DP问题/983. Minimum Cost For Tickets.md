#    Minimum Cost For Tickets 

## 问题描述

In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance. The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array `days`. Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
- a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
- a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel. For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= days.length <= 365`
2. `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
3. `days` is in strictly increasing order.
4. `costs.length == 3`
5. `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

## 解题思路

首先回顾一下找零问题的状态转移方程：`DP[i][j] = min(DP[i-1][j - coins[i]] + 1,DP[i-1][j])`

这问题其实就是找零问题和完全背包问题的一个简单变形,假设第`d`天出行的花费为$F[d]$ ，将365天全部初始化为`MAX_INT`。



### 状态方程确定

第`d`天的最小花费是**前一天**加上1天的票钱就是`cost[0]` ，或者d -7 ,d- 30天加cost[1],cost[30]的钱最小的值。

将365天全部初始化为`MAX_INT`，也就是说，如果我们买的票不能到

$F[day] = min(F[d - day[i]] + cost[i], F[d - 1][d + day[0]] + cost[0])$ 

显然的第`days[0]`出门的花费一定是`cost[0]`元（因为第一天出门当前最优的就是只买一天的票）。

### 边界条件和初始化值确定

==有些天数是没有包含再需要出行的数组里面的，那这些天数的所花的钱应该是多少？应该是上一个出行天花费的钱！！！！==

声明一个数组minCost[366] 表示最佳花费，初始值DP[day[0]] = cost[0]，另外，DP[d < day[0]] = 0



### 伪代码

```
dp = int[365]
for d < day[o]:
	dp[d] = 0
dp[day[0]] = cost[0]
for d := day[0];d < 365;d++{
	for c in costs:
	dp[d] = min(dp[d - 1] + cost[0],dp[d - cd[i]])
}
```



```java

public  static  int mincostTickets(int[] days, int[] costs) {
           int[] dp = new int[366];
           boolean[] dayInclude = new boolean[366];

           for (int index = 0;index < days.length - 1;index++) {
               dayInclude[days[index]] = true;
           }
           dp[0] = costs[0];
           for (int day = days[0];day <= days[days.length - 1];day++) {
               if (!dayInclude[day]) {
                   dp[day] = dp[day - 1];
                   continue;
               }
               int min = Math.min(dp[day - 1] + costs[0], dp[Math.max(day- 7,0)] + costs[1]);
               dp[day] = Math.min(min,dp[Math.max(day - 30,0)] + costs[2]);
           }
           return dp[days[days.length - 1]];
       }
```



初始化条件和边界一定要确定好，不然很难解
